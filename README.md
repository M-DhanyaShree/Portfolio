# Portfolio
Personal portfolio website created as part of the ShadowFox virtual internship using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap.
This is my personal portfolio website, created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It serves as an interactive platform to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The website features a clean, responsive design that adapts across various devices and screen sizes. It includes sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, Resume, and Contact, with smooth scrolling and animated transitions to enhance user experience. Bootstrap components were utilized for layout and responsiveness, while JavaScript adds interactivity such as form validation and dynamic content display. This portfolio reflects my front-end development capabilities and design aesthetics.
